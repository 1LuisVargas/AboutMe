        <h1>What is my full educational background?</h1>
        <p>
            I completed my highschool in Punto Fijo, Venezuela, in "Unidad Educativa Colegio Araguaney" on June 2016. In January 2017, I moved to Caracas because I was admitted into "Universidad Simón Bolívar", which is to this date --April 11th, 2023-- still one of the best universities in LATAM and even in the world. The "Universidad Simón Bolívar" is still top 1000 best universities in the World according to QS Top Universities ranking, which you can check <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universidad-simon-bolivar-usb">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I moved to Caracas and started my Electronic Engineering undergraduate studies in Universidad Simón Bolívar. I really enjoyed my time in the university, but due to uncontrollable circumstances I was practically forced to leave the university. At this time, June 2018, Venezuela was already deep into a very strong economic crisis, one which my parents were unable to elude, and effectively meant they were unable to continue affording the expenses of financially supporting me on while studying on a different city, which implied paying for rent, food, and all other basic expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is now July 2018, and I'm faced with a difficult choice. Go back to Punto Fijo and study Electronic Engineering in a local university, one with a lesser quality of education, or try to make it on my own in a completely new country. I chose the ladder and moved to Colombia to start all over again, but now looking for a job, trying to get into a top university in Colombia, so that I could financially maintain myself, while at the same time continuing my education in a high-quality university.
